# Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a **Recommendation System** using collaborative filtering and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The system provides personalized recommendations based on user preferences and behavior patterns. The project focuses on improving user engagement and enhancing customer experience by suggesting relevant items.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes user-item interactions to provide personalized recommendations.
- **NLP Techniques**: Leverages text-based analysis for content-based recommendations.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Involves cleaning, transforming, and normalizing raw data for better model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Includes metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the recommendation model's effectiveness.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently and scale with increasing data volume.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-Learn
  - TensorFlow
  - NLTK (for NLP)
  - Surprise (for collaborative filtering)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Installation and Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/recommendation-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd recommendation-system
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the main script to generate recommendations:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset used for building the recommendation system.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model building.
- **src/**: Contains the main Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **models/**: Trained models and results from the evaluation phase.
- **README.md**: This file containing the project documentation.

## Usage

- After setting up the environment, you can run the scripts in the `src` folder to preprocess the data, train the recommendation model, and evaluate its performance.
- The model can be used to provide recommendations based on user inputs or interactions.

## Results

- Achieved significant improvement in user engagement through personalized recommendations.
- Successfully enhanced model accuracy and scalability by applying collaborative filtering and NLP techniques.

## Future Enhancements

- Implementing deep learning-based recommendation algorithms for further accuracy improvements.
- Integrating additional data sources, such as social media interactions and user reviews, to refine recommendations.
- Deploying the recommendation system using cloud services for real-time recommendations.
